This project is an Mp3 Player that allows someone to create playlists, add songs to playlists, delete songs from playlist, etc.
To add a playlist click on "View Playlists" after opening the program, then click add playlist
You can create a new playlist by naming a playlist and clicking create, or you can create a playlist that is already saved to your computer
While looking at the view playlist button you can edit a playlist, or delete a playlist
In order to play a song click "Play" on the home screen
On the play screen click on the playlist that you want to listen to, then click "Select Playlist"
Click on a song that you want to listen to
